# FRACTALMAKE

## What is it?
This is a toy program for generating fractal images from a flexible input file
format that's easy to type by hand or generate using scripting. It produces
bitmap images from a set of parameters defining the fractal.

## How does it work?
fractalmake produces fractals that are generated by the iteration of a function
with the form $f(z,c)$ where $z,c \in \mathbb{C}$.
